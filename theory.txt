SINGLE PAGE APPLICATIONS VS ONE PAGE WEBSITE :

1 -> SINGLE PAGE WEBSITE :
     
     IN THESE WEBSITE ALL THE CONTENT IS SHOWN ON THE SAME PAGE , FOR EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE WANTS TO GO TO THE ABOUT US PAGE THAN THE URL OF THE SCREEN WILL BE CHANGED AND THE CONTENT  WILL BE SHOWN ON THE SAME PAGE WITHOUT RENDERING TO THE ANOTHER PAGE.


2 -> ONE PAGE WEBSITE :

    IN THIS ALL THE CONTENT IS MADE IN SINGLE PAGE AND WITH THE HELP OF LINKS IT IS NAVIGATED TO THE PARAGRAPGH OR SECTION REQUIRED.

I added some demo texts in the file from GitHub.
